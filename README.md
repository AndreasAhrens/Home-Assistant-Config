## Goal of automation
I would like to automate the home to such a degree that everything just works and we understand our home completely without intervention. That includes understanding intentions and behaviour and adjusting to it. We are far from the end goal, but a pretty good way along at least. The bedroom is fully automated when it comes to lights, fan and rollers, we never have to manually adjust it anymore. The livingroom is rather close to perfectly automated. 

My vision of an automated home is one that adapts to the inhabitants, not the other way around. The lights should be the right level for the actions taken and the time of day, the home should clean itself when nobody is around to hear the vacuum, rollers should be down when changing clothes or sleeping and up during the day. The lawn should be cut when children are not out to play. The car should be started, removed from the garage and warmed up when someone is ready to leave. 

Somethings are still dreams or just too expensive to accomplish at the moment, such as a washer and dryer that loads, starts and unloads by themselves. Getting a little bit closer to the dream every month is my goal though. I usually build or automate at least a few things per month.

- Set bedroom lights to bright or low depending on time and close bedroom rollers
